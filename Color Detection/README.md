#  Real-Time Color Detection using OpenCV and Python

The program captures live video from the camera feed and converts it into the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space for better color analysis.

The user can select a target color by providing its BGR (Blue, Green, Red) values, and the program then converts these values into the corresponding HSV range. As the camera feed runs, the program masks the video to highlight regions containing the selected color, effectively isolating it from the rest of the image.
